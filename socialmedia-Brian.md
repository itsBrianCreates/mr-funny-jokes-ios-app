## Raw Notes

**What happened this session:**
- Removed the entire video tab feature from Mr. Funny Jokes iOS app
- Deleted ~1,300 lines of code across 5 files (VideoFeedView, VideoPlayerView, VideoViewModel, VideoService, Video model)
- Cleaned up references in 3 files (app entry point, local storage, character model)
- Removed "Brian" as a video-only character since videos are gone
- App now has 3 clean tabs: Home, Me, Search

**Potential angles:**
- Hook 1: Sometimes shipping means deleting. Killed a feature today.
- Hook 2: 1,300 lines deleted. Zero regrets.
- Hook 3: The hardest part of building isn't adding features. It's removing them.

Sometimes the best code is the code you delete.

Removed 1,300 lines from Mr. Funny Jokes today. The video tab is gone. 5 files deleted, 3 files cleaned up, and the app is simpler for it.

Git history has my back if I ever want it back.
