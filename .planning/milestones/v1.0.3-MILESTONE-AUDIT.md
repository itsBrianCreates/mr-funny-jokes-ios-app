# v1.0.3 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0.3 — Seasonal Content & Scroll Fix
**Audited:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** passed
**Phases:** 11-12 (2 phases, 2 plans)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Verification Status | Score | Gaps |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------|------|
| 11 | Seasonal Content Ranking | passed | 4/4 truths verified | None |
| 12 | Feed Scroll Stability | human_needed (infrastructure verified, human approved) | 4/4 artifacts verified | Visual scroll tests need human eyes (approved per SUMMARY) |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| SEASON-01: Christmas jokes pushed to bottom outside Nov 1 - Dec 31 | 11 | SATISFIED | JokeViewModel.filteredJokes + CharacterDetailViewModel.filteredJokes apply partition-and-append |
| SEASON-02: Christmas jokes rank normally within Nov 1 - Dec 31 | 11 | SATISFIED | SeasonalHelper.isChristmasSeason() skips demotion when true |
| SEASON-03: Seasonal demotion applies to all feed contexts | 11 | SATISFIED | Both main feed and character feeds apply demotion after category filter |
| SCROLL-01: No scroll jumps on iOS 18+ | 12 | SATISFIED | Stable ForEach(feedJokes) with Identifiable conformance (no enumerated) |
| SCROLL-02: Stable scroll position during background loading | 12 | SATISFIED | Scoped withAnimation at mutation sites, no implicit .animation() on ScrollView |
| SCROLL-03: Conditional content doesn't destabilize scroll anchors | 12 | SATISFIED | YouTube promo extracted as standalone LazyVStack item outside ForEach |

**Score:** 6/6 requirements satisfied

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Connected exports:** 4/4
**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0
**Conflicts in shared files:** 0

### Shared Files

Both phases modified JokeViewModel.swift and CharacterDetailViewModel.swift without conflicts:
- Phase 11: Seasonal demotion logic in `filteredJokes` computed properties
- Phase 12: Scoped `withAnimation` for `isLoadingMore`/`isOffline` state mutations

Changes target different sections with zero overlap.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Main feed: seasonal demotion + smooth scroll | COMPLETE |
| Character feed: seasonal demotion + smooth scroll | COMPLETE |
| Category filter: demotion preserved + smooth scroll | COMPLETE |
| Background load: position stable + seasonal order preserved | COMPLETE |
| Scroll past promo card: no anchor shift + correct order | COMPLETE |

**Score:** 5/5 flows complete

## Anti-Patterns

None detected across either phase. No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or placeholders.

## Tech Debt (Pre-existing, Not from v1.0.3)

- Collection named "weekly_rankings" but UI shows "Monthly" (cosmetic)
- Firebase bundle ID warning in Xcode (informational only)
- Local crontab entry needs manual removal

## Conclusion

All 6 requirements satisfied. Cross-phase integration verified with no conflicts. All 5 E2E flows complete. No new tech debt introduced. Milestone is ready for completion.
