**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (13, 14, 15, 16): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (13.1, 14.1): Urgent insertions if needed (marked with INSERTED)

- [x] **Phase 13: Data Migration & Cloud Function** — Migrate existing ratings to binary format and deploy all-time aggregation (completed 2026-02-18)
- [x] **Phase 14: Binary Rating UI** — Replace 5-emoji slider with Hilarious/Horrible segmented control (completed 2026-02-18)
- [x] **Phase 15: Me Tab Redesign** — Simplify Me tab from 5 sections to binary segmented control (completed 2026-02-18)
- [x] **Phase 16: All-Time Leaderboard UI** — Replace Monthly Top 10 with All-Time Top 10 across all UI (completed 2026-02-18)

## Phase Details

### Phase 13: Data Migration & Cloud Function
**Goal**: Existing user ratings are preserved in binary format and all-time rankings data is available for consumption
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1.0)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, RATE-05, TOP-02, TOP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Feature branch `v1.1.0` exists and all v1.1.0 work happens on it
  2. User who previously rated jokes with 1-5 scale sees their ratings preserved after app update (4-5 become Hilarious, 1-2 become Horrible, 3s cleanly removed)
  3. Cloud Function produces an all-time rankings document that reflects all historical rating data
  4. Firestore rating_events collection contains only binary-compatible rating values (old 2-4 values cleaned or handled by aggregation)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Feature branch, Firestore migration script, Cloud Function all-time update
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Local rating migration in iOS app (UserDefaults binary conversion)

### Phase 14: Binary Rating UI
**Goal**: Users rate jokes with a clear two-option choice that feels responsive and satisfying
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: RATE-01, RATE-02, RATE-03, RATE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees a segmented control with Hilarious and Horrible options on every joke detail (no trace of old 5-emoji slider)
  2. Tapping a rating option triggers haptic feedback and a smooth visual transition
  3. User can change their rating by tapping the other option and the change persists
  4. Rated jokes show the correct binary indicator (Hilarious or Horrible emoji) on feed cards
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Replace rating UI components with binary Hilarious/Horrible controls
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Remove defunct Me tab sections and dead ViewModel properties

### Phase 15: Me Tab Redesign
**Goal**: Users can browse their rated jokes organized by Hilarious and Horrible with a consistent, clean interface
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: ME-01, ME-02, ME-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Me tab displays a segmented control with two segments: Hilarious and Horrible (no trace of old 5-section layout)
  2. Each segment shows a count badge indicating how many jokes are in that category
  3. Me tab visual pattern matches All-Time Top 10 detail view (consistent segmented control styling)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Segmented Me tab with count badges and dead code cleanup

### Phase 16: All-Time Leaderboard UI
**Goal**: Users see an all-time Top 10 leaderboard that reflects the cumulative best and worst jokes
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: TOP-01, TOP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All UI that previously showed "Monthly Top 10" now shows "All-Time Top 10" (headers, navigation, carousel)
  2. Leaderboard displays rankings sourced from the all-time Cloud Function data (not time-windowed)
  3. No references to "Monthly", date ranges, or week periods remain anywhere in the app UI
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Rename Monthly to All-Time, rewire data source, rename files/folders
