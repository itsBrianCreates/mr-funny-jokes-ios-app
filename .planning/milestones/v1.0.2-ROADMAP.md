**Phases:** 10
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Bug fix release addressing Me tab rating persistence and YouTube promo dismissal. Focused maintenance release with 2 bonus UX improvements discovered during human testing.

## Phases

### Phase 10: Bug Fixes & UX Polish

**Goal**: Fix Me tab persistence bug and add YouTube promo dismissal
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (rating persistence infrastructure)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Me tab rating persistence fix and YouTube promo dismissal

**Requirements:**
- ME-01: Rated jokes persist correctly across app sessions
- ME-02: Rated jokes remain visible after pull-to-refresh
- PROMO-01: User can dismiss YouTube promo with X button
- PROMO-02: YouTube promo auto-hides after Subscribe click
- PROMO-03: Promo dismissal state persists across app sessions

**Success Criteria:** All 5 verified ✓
1. ✓ User rates a joke, closes app, reopens — joke still appears in Me tab
2. ✓ User pulls to refresh Me tab — rated jokes remain visible
3. ✓ User taps X on YouTube promo — promo disappears immediately
4. ✓ User clicks Subscribe button — promo hidden on next refresh/session
5. ✓ User closes and reopens app — promo dismissal state persists

**Bonus fixes from user testing:**
- Me tab now shows most recently rated jokes first
- Pull-to-refresh properly bounces back to top

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Explicit rating re-application in loadInitialContentAsync for consistency with all other load paths

- YouTube promo with no way to dismiss after viewing
- Me tab showing arbitrary order instead of recency
- Pull-to-refresh not bouncing back to top

**Issues Deferred:**
- None
