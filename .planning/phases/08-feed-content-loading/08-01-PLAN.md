<objective>
Implement automatic infinite scroll in the main joke feed, removing the manual "Load More" button.

Purpose: Users can browse jokes continuously without tapping a button, matching the pattern already established in CharacterDetailView.

Output: JokeFeedView with automatic scroll-triggered pagination.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add automatic scroll-triggered loading to JokeFeedView</name>
  <files>MrFunnyJokes/MrFunnyJokes/Views/JokeFeedView.swift</files>
  <action>
Adapt the infinite scroll pattern from CharacterDetailView to JokeFeedView:

1. In the ForEach loop for feedJokes, add `.onAppear` modifier to each joke card that calls `viewModel.loadMoreIfNeeded(currentItem: joke)`. This triggers loading when user scrolls near the bottom. The pattern already exists in CharacterDetailView lines 176-179.

2. Remove the LoadMoreButton section entirely:
   - Delete the conditional block: `if !viewModel.isLoadingMore && viewModel.hasMoreJokes && !feedJokes.isEmpty { LoadMoreButton { ... } }`
   - Keep the LoadingMoreView (skeleton cards) - it's already shown when `viewModel.isLoadingMore` is true

3. Keep LoadMoreButton view definition in the file (but don't use it) - we may need it for reference or other screens.

The existing `viewModel.loadMoreIfNeeded(currentItem:)` method in JokeViewModel already implements threshold detection (3 items from end), so no changes needed there for this task.

Build the app in Xcode:
- `xcodebuild -project MrFunnyJokes/MrFunnyJokes.xcodeproj -scheme MrFunnyJokes -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build 2>&1 | tail -20`
- Verify no build errors
- Verify LoadMoreButton no longer appears in feed by searching the view body
  </verify>
  <done>
- JokeFeedView calls loadMoreIfNeeded on each joke card's onAppear
- LoadMoreButton is not rendered in the feed (view definition can remain)
- App builds successfully
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Build succeeds without errors
2. In JokeFeedView body, LoadMoreButton is not rendered
3. Each joke card in ForEach has .onAppear calling loadMoreIfNeeded
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- App builds and runs
- Scrolling through the feed triggers automatic loading when approaching the end
- No "Load More Jokes" button visible in the feed
- Skeleton cards appear at bottom while loading more jokes
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-feed-content-loading/08-01-SUMMARY.md`
