  <what-built>Test checklist from Plan 05-01</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Testing Instructions:**

1. Open TEST-CHECKLIST.md from `.planning/phases/05-testing-bug-fixes/`
2. Work through each section in priority order (Siri first)
3. Check off each item as you test
4. Report any bugs immediately using the format in the checklist

**Bug Reporting Format:**
```
BUG: [Short description]
- Where: [Screen/feature]
- Steps: [How to reproduce]
- Expected: [What should happen]
- Actual: [What actually happened]
```

**Severity Guide:**
- **Blocking:** Crashes OR broken features (must fix before release)
- **Cosmetic:** Visual issues, minor polish (track for v1.1 backlog)

**When Complete:**
- If all tests pass: Type "all tests passed"
- If bugs found: Report each bug, wait for fix, re-test, then confirm
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "all tests passed" or report bugs for immediate fixing</resume-signal>
</task>
