## Capture Instructions

### 1. Siri Screenshot

1. Open the Shortcuts app and find "Tell Me a Joke"
2. Tap the shortcut to trigger Siri
3. Wait for Siri to start speaking (dialog bubble appears)
4. Take screenshot while the joke text is visible in Siri's response bubble
5. Tip: Practice timing - you want the full joke visible

### 2. Home Screen Widget Screenshot

1. Add the medium-sized Mr. Funny Jokes widget to your Home Screen
2. Position it alongside other commonly-used apps for context
3. Wait for the Joke of the Day to load
4. Take screenshot showing the widget with character branding and joke text
5. Tip: Choose a joke with short text that displays fully

### 3. Lock Screen Widget Screenshot

1. Add a rectangular widget to your Lock Screen
2. Make sure the joke text is visible (not truncated)
3. Wake your phone (don't unlock) to show the Lock Screen
4. Take screenshot with the widget clearly visible
5. Tip: The rectangular widget shows character name + joke setup

### 4. Character Carousel Screenshot

1. Open the app to the Home tab
2. Scroll to show 2-3 character cards visible
3. Take screenshot capturing the colorful character selection
4. Tip: Show Mr. Funny as the primary card - he's the mascot

### 5. Joke Card Screenshot

1. Tap into any character to view their jokes
2. Swipe to a joke with a good punchline
3. Take screenshot showing the joke card, character avatar, and action buttons
4. Tip: Choose a short joke that fits on one screen without scrolling

### 6. Settings Screenshot

1. Navigate to the Settings tab
2. Make sure the notification toggle is visible
3. Take screenshot showing the clean settings interface

## Screenshot Tips

- **Use a physical device** - Simulator screenshots can look artificial
- **Use real joke content** - Avoid placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum"
- **Show context** - Widgets should appear alongside other apps/widgets
- **Clean Home Screen** - Remove clutter from non-essential app icons
- **Good lighting** - For Lock Screen, make sure time/date is readable
- **Check both modes** - Light mode is typically preferred for App Store
- **Verify text is readable** - Jokes should be legible, not truncated
