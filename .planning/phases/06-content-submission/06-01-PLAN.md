Mr. Funny Jokes delivers native iOS integration through Siri Shortcuts, Home Screen
and Lock Screen Widgets, and Local Notifications. Here's how to test each:

SIRI SHORTCUTS
1. Open the Shortcuts app
2. Search for "Mr. Funny Jokes" - the "Tell Me a Joke" shortcut appears automatically
3. Tap the shortcut to hear Siri speak a joke
4. Alternative: Say "Tell me a joke from Mr. Funny Jokes"
5. Expected: Siri speaks the joke without opening the app

HOME SCREEN WIDGETS
[testing steps...]

LOCK SCREEN WIDGETS

NOTIFICATIONS
[testing steps...]

Note: All features work offline using cached jokes after initial app launch.
```

**APP-STORE-DESCRIPTION.md**
Create with playful, character-driven tone per CONTEXT.md:
- Hook in first 255 characters (visible before "more" button)
- Feature highlights (Siri, widgets, notifications)
- Character introductions (Mr. Funny, Mr. Potty, Mr. Bad, Mr. Love, Mr. Sad)
- Native iOS integration callouts

Include both:
1. **Description** - Full 4000 character limit available
2. **What's New** - Version update notes highlighting new features

Structure:
```

Create screenshot guidance document for user to capture required App Store screenshots:

**SCREENSHOT-GUIDE.md**
Based on RESEARCH.md screenshot guidance:

**Required Screenshots (6 minimum for native feature demonstration):**

| Priority | Screen | Purpose | Capture Tips |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Siri in action | Native integration demo | Capture while Siri is speaking joke (shows dialog bubble) |
| 2 | Home screen widget (medium) | Native integration | Show widget alongside other apps for context |
| 3 | Lock screen widget | Native integration | Show rectangular widget with joke text visible |
| 4 | Home/Character carousel | Main app experience | Show character selection with colorful cards |
| 5 | Joke card display | Core functionality | Show joke with character avatar and share button |
| 6 | Settings | Feature discovery | Show notification toggle and Siri tip |

**Screenshot Tips:**
- Capture on physical device (not simulator) for authentic appearance
- Use actual joke content, not placeholder text
- For widgets: show WITH other apps/widgets for context
- For Siri: trigger shortcut and capture while speech bubble is visible
- Test both light and dark mode if time permits

**Device Requirements:**
- iPhone 6.5" display (iPhone 15 Pro Max, 14 Pro Max, etc.) - required
- iPhone 5.5" display (iPhone 8 Plus) - optional but recommended

Include instructions on how to capture each screenshot type.
