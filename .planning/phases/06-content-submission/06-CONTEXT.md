# Phase 6: Content & Submission - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Load 500 jokes into Firebase (user-provided) and prepare App Store resubmission materials after Guideline 4.2.2 rejection. Focus on demonstrating native iOS integration through updated copy, App Review Notes, and screenshot guidance.

## Implementation Decisions

### Joke Loading
- User provides and loads all 500 jokes manually
- Use existing `scripts/add-jokes.js` workflow from CLAUDE.md
- No automated content generation or sourcing needed

### App Review Notes
- Lead with summary sentence highlighting ALL new native features (Siri, widgets, notifications)
- Break down each feature below the summary with specific testing steps
- Written testing steps only — no demo video
- Emphasize native iOS integration to address 4.2.2 rejection

### App Store Copy
- Playful/fun tone to match joke app personality
- Update description to highlight new features (Siri, widgets, notifications)
- Update "What's New" section for this version

### Screenshots
- User captures screenshots manually
- Provide guidance on which screens to capture (widgets, Siri in action, etc.)
- No automated screenshot generation

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact wording of App Review Notes testing steps
- Structure of App Store description
- Order of features in "What's New"

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Lead with a sentence highlighting all that is new then break it down below" for App Review Notes
- Include notifications alongside Siri and widgets as key native features
- Tone should be light, punny, character-driven to match the app personality
